Learn Code The Hard Way

This repository houses my personal records and learning journey using Zed Shaw's "Learn Code the Hard Way" (learncodethehardway.org)

It will include examples from his various books, starting with "Learn Ruby the Hard Way" (learnrubythehardway.org). Example exercise: 'ex6.rb'
